Since Unix domain sockets only work for local communication, weâ€™ll still need to ensure the client and server run on the same host.

Shared Volumes: The server and client both use /tmp as the location for the Unix domain socket file (/tmp/uds_socket). We mount the host's /tmp directory to both containers using volumes to share the same file system space.

Communication: The client and server communicate through the Unix domain socket located at /tmp/uds_socket.
